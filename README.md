# Snake Game with AI

## Overview
In this project, we leverage the power of Python along with PyTorch and Pygame to implement a Reinforcement Learning (RL) system aimed at training an AI to master the classic game of Snake. By combining Python's versatility, PyTorch's robust machine learning capabilities, and Pygame's user-friendly game development framework, we embark on a journey to teach an AI agent how to navigate the challenges of the Snake game through trial and error. This project offers an exciting opportunity to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and gaming, providing insights into reinforcement learning techniques while delivering an engaging and interactive experience. Join us as we delve into the world of Python, PyTorch, and Pygame to train an AI to become a Snake game champion! üêçüéÆ

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment using `virtualenv myvenv`.
4. Activate the virtual environment using `source myvenv/bin/activate` (for Unix-based systems) or `myvenv\Scripts\activate` (for Windows).
5. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
- Run the Snake game with AI by executing the main script.
- Watch as the AI autonomously maneuvers the snake to capture food and avoid obstacles.
